# RockPaperScissors
Playing Rock Paper scissors with computer

---

## Description

- This is a little something I threw together to mess around with message boxes in matlab. It still has some work that needs to be done, but I thought it was fun to play around with
- To use this program you run it and then select either rock, paper or scissors. Then the computer randomly picks one to play and then it keeps track of wins and losses.

## TODO
- [x] Make it actually run (kept crashing from memory overflow)
- [ ] Adjust menu configurations
- [ ] Make it more obvious when you win or loose instead of displaying it in command window
